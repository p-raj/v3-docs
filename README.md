# What is Veris? 

Veris is a platform that enables interaction, within some context, between multiple entities, and evantually creates an ecosystem of trust between the entities.
Veris Does this by defining
- context
- interaction
- entities
    - user
    - organization
    - access control
    - etc
and then monitoring the data exchange between entities. When all the entities involved in the interaction provide a feedback, about the interaction, the trust score in the context for the entities involved is updated.
Using this theory, ultimately Veris would be able to create a Trust Eco-system, where in all the interacting entities would have a direct access to each other, removing the friction caused by involvement of multiple process access grant.

Use Cases for context & interaction

- VMS and organization
- Logbook and society
- Ticket Booking and theater
- Meeting Manager and conference room
- Loan application portal and bank
- Network packets and Embedded systems

# Execution Strategy

Veris would provide any Organization a way to enable multiple services for its member, and thus using the services a member would be better able to judge the value of membership and the organization would be better able to judge the access to be granted to the member.

Organization IT developer would be able to register
- external resources
    - data model
    - permissions
    - authentication
- create new processes using all the required resources
- create new widget screens to call the processes
- compile the processes and widget screens into a single widget

Organization Admin would be able to use all the widgets required by the organization, and distribute it across the members of its organization.

This would be known as Instant App (instant widget), where in Admin can quickly create a widget, and choose to serve it to the members. The members must use the Veris Runtime to access the allowed widgets.

Users gain more power over the IDs and Membership, using the Veris Runtime User App and Organization gains more agility over the services it wants to deliver to its members.

# Culture-Values

Total members of the team would have been around 12 if the others would not have quit.
The people who joined the team (or were selected, joined but quite too early)
- amit
- priya
- himanshu
- arjith
- lakshya
- sparsh

And no one ever discussed the real issue behind "why is everyone leaving?"
it would have been a simple enough discussion - 
- the current vision of company is blurred
- the current management is not capable of properly managing the team.

I guess there was a lack of trust and respect.

After the discussion today (25th Feb 2017), I am briefly writing about what should our team's core values should be

# Values
