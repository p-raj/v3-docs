Total members of the team would have been around 12 if the others would not have quit.
The people who joined the team (or were selected, joined but quite too early)
- amit
- priya
- himanshu
- arjith
- lakshya
- sparsh

And no one ever discussed the real issue behind "why is everyone leaving?"
it would have been a simple enough discussion - 
- the current vision of company is blurred
- the current management is not capable of properly managing the team.

I guess there was a lack of trust and respect.

After the discussion today (25th Feb 2017), I am briefly writing about what should our team's core values should be
